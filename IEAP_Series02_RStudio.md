# Title of the project: IEAP-Series 02-RStudio

# Author: Hugo Duchemin

# Short description
The goal of this project was to practice using R and GitHub by performing statistical analyses on different datasets. We analyzed the effect of rehabilitation training using statistical tests. Additionally, we performed analyses to answer questions related to social issues, such as stereotypes (e.g., are men heavier than women?), based on a dataset. This project allowed us to improve our skills in R and Git while applying statistical analysis to real-world questions.

# Example of code used to answer different stereotypes
- Test of normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test)
- Parametric or non-parametric statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Wilcoxon test)
- Visualization of the results (e.g., boxplot)
- Interpretation of the results (e.g., p-values)

# Requirements
This project requires the following R packages: `dplyr`, `lsr`, and `vcd`. All of them were installed via the R console to perform the different analyses.

# Time to complete the project
Approximately 6 hours

# Results summary
- A significant association was found between snoring status and alcohol consumption.  
- A significant association was found between sex and tobacco consumption, with women smoking less than men in our dataset.  
- Rehabilitation training did not reduce heart rate as expected; instead, a small increase was observed in the post-training phase.
